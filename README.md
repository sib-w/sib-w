# 👋 Hi, I'm Siber Gunes Celik

I'm a molecular biologist and neuroscience graduate with hands-on experience in genome analysis and next-generation sequencing (NGS). I recently relocated to the U.S. and am currently expanding my skill set in bioinformatics, data science, and machine learning.

 **Background:**  
- B.Sc. in Molecular Biology and Genetics  
- M.Sc. in Neuroscience  
- Former Genome Analyst at Gen Era Diagnostics (focused on clinical genetic testing and NGS data interpretation)

 **What I'm learning now:**  
- Python for data science  
- Git & GitHub  
- Machine learning for genomics  
- Data visualization (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn)  
- Tools: Colab, Jupyter, scikit-learn  

**Areas of interest:**  
- Bioinformatics & genomic data analysis  
- Translational research  
- Conservation & evolutionary genomics  
- Making science accessible to underserved communities

 **How to reach me:**  
- LinkedIn: [www.linkedin.com/in/sib--1b5510114]  
- Email: [sibergunes@gmail.com]  
- GitHub: You're already here!

 I'm currently working on personal projects that combine biology and machine learning, and I’m open to collaboration and new opportunities!
